# Hooked
**MIDI-capable chord progression builder**

Hooked is an interactive Circle of Fifths, used for exploring chord progressions given you have a MIDI instrument on your computer. It's integrated with the HookTheory API to create probabilistic chord recommendations based on your current chord sequence, and allows you to store your saved progressions for future use. 

**Demo:**
You can check out the demo [here](https://github.com/mbryan13/Hooked/assets/102488255/dafb7c18-4654-4919-8686-cf79c99aa18f).

**Note:**
I'm currently not actively developing this project, but future potential iterations may include:

- Significant UI improvements, including the ability to adjust BPM.
- Addition of a sequencer to create varying rhythmic patterns.
- Inclusion of all possible chord qualities.
